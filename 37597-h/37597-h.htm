<h2>An Evening with a Conjuror.</h2>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A Suburban Hall. The Performance has not yet begun. The
Audience is limited and low-spirited, and may perhaps number&mdash;including
the Attendants&mdash;eighteen. The only people in the front seats
are a man in full evening dress, which he tries to conceal under a caped
coat, and two Ladies in plush opera-cloaks. Fog is hanging about in
the rafters, and the gas-stars sing a melancholy dirge. Each casual
cough arouses dismal echoes. Enter an intending Spectator, who is
conducted to a seat in the middle of an empty row. After removing his
hat and coat, he suddenly thinks better&mdash;or worse&mdash;of it, puts them on
again, and vanishes hurriedly.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Sardonic Attendant</span> (<i>at doorway</i>). Reg'lar turnin' em away
to-night, <i>we</i> are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Sardonic Attendant</span>. He come up to me afore he goes
to the pay-box, and sez he&mdash;"Is there a seat left?" he sez. And I sez
to 'im, "Well, I <i>think</i> we can manage to squeeze you in somewhere."
Like that, I sez.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>The Orchestra, consisting of two thin-armed little girls, with
pigtails, enter, and perform a stumbling Overture upon a
cracked piano.</i> <span class="smcap">Herr Von Kamberwohl</span><i>, the Conjuror, appears on
platform, amidst loud clapping from two obvious Confederates in a back row</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[ 2]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herr V. K.</span> (<i>in a mixed accent</i>). Lyties and Shentilmans, pefoor
I co-mence viz my hillusions zis hevenin' I 'ave most hemphadically
to repoodiate hall assistance from hany spirrids or soopernatural beins
vatsohever. All I shall 'ave ze honour of showing you will be perform
by simple Sloight of 'and or Ledger-dee-Mang! (<i>He invites any member
of the Audience to step up and assist him, but the spectators remain coy.</i>)
I see zat I 'ave not to night so larsh an orjence to select from as usual,
still I 'ope&mdash;(<i>Here one of the obvious Confederates slouches up, and joins
him on the platform.</i>) Ah, zat is goot! I am vair much oblige to you,
Sare. (<i>The Confederate grins sheepishly.</i>) Led me see&mdash;I seem to
remember your face some'ow. (<i>Broader grin from Confederate.</i>) Hah
you vos 'ere last night?&mdash;zat exblains it! But you 'ave nevaire assist
me befoor, eh? (<i>Reckless shake of the head from Confederate.</i>) I thought
nod. <i>Vair</i> vell. You 'ave nevaire done any dricks mit carts&mdash;no?
Bot you will dry? You never dell vat you gan do till you dry, as ze ole
sow said ven she learn ze halphabet. (<i>He pauses for a laugh&mdash;which
doesn't come.</i>) Now, Sare, you know a cart ven you see 'im? Ah, zat
is somtings alretty! Now I vill ask you to choose any cart or carts
out of zis back. (<i>The Confederate fumbles.</i>) I don't vish to 'urry you&mdash;but
I vant you to mike 'aste&mdash;&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Man in Evening Dress.</span> I remember giving Bimbo, the Wizard
of the West, a guinea once to teach me that trick&mdash;there was nothing in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Lady in Plush Cloak.</span> And can you <i>do</i> it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The M. in E. D.</span> (<i>guardedly</i>). Well, I don't know that I could
exactly do it <i>now</i>&mdash;but I know how it's done.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>He explains elaborately how it is done.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herr V. K.</span> (<i>stamping, as a signal that the Orchestra may leave off</i>).
Next I shall show you my zelebrated hillusion of ze inexhaustible 'At,
to gonclude viz the Invisible 'En. And I shall be moch oblige if any
shentilmans vill kindly favour me viz 'is 'at for ze purpose of my
exberiment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The M. in E. D.</span> Here's mine&mdash;it's quite at your service. [<i>To his

leaf nossing insoide of your 'at?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The M. in E. D.</span> (<i>with a wink to his neighbours</i>). On the contrary,
there are several little things there belonging to me, which I'll thank
you to give me back by-and-by.</p>

Ha, do you alvays garry flowairs insoide your 'at, Sare?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The M. in E. D.</span> Invariably&mdash;to keep my head cool; so hand them

<p><span class="smcap">The M. in E. D.</span> (<i>with rather feeble indignation</i>). I never said

<p><span class="smcap">Herr V. K.</span> No, zere is no mahouse&mdash;bot&mdash;[<i>diving again</i>]&mdash;ha!

don't loike the vide rads myself, it is madder of daste. [<i>The Audience

<p class="center">[<i>He showers cards, commending somebody's self-adjusting trousers
amongst the Audience, each person receiving about two dozen&mdash;chiefly
in the eye&mdash;until the air is dark, and the floor thick
with them.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The M. in E. D.</span> (<i>much annoyed</i>). Infernal liberty! Confounded
impudence! Shouldn't have had <i>my</i> hat if I'd known he was going to
play the fool with it like this!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[ 5]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Lady in Plush Cloak.</span> But I thought you knew what was
coming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The M. in E. D.</span> So I did&mdash;but this fellow does it differently.</p>

<p class="center">[<span class="smcap">Herr Von K.</span> <i>is preparing to fire a marked half-crown from a
blunderbuss into a crystal casket</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Lady with Nerves</span> (<i>to her husband</i>). John, I'm <i>sure</i> he's going
to let that thing off!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>a Brute</i>). Well, I shouldn't be surprised if he is. <i>I</i> can't
help it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The L. with N.</span> You could if you liked&mdash;you could tell him my
nerves won't stand it&mdash;the trick will be every <i>bit</i> as good if he only
<i>pretends</i> to fire, I'm sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Oh, nonsense!&mdash;You can stand it very well if you <i>like</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The L. with N.</span> I <i>can't</i>, John.... There, he's raising it to his
shoulder. John, I <i>must</i> go out. I shall scream if I sit here, I <i>know</i>
I shall!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> No, no&mdash;what's the use? He'll have fired long before you
get to the door. Much better stay where you are, and do your
screaming sitting down. (<i>The Conjuror fires.</i>) There, you see, you
<i>didn't</i> scream, after all!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The L. with N.</span> I screamed to <i>myself</i>&mdash;which is ever so much worse
for me; but you never <i>will</i> understand me till it's too late!</p>

<p class="center">[<span class="smcap">Herr Von K.</span> <i>performs another trick</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Lady in Plush Cloak.</span> That was very clever, wasn't it?
I can't <i>imagine</i> how it was done!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The M. in E. D.</span> (<i>in whom the memory of his desecrated hat is still
rankling</i>). Oh, can't you? Simplest thing in the world&mdash;any child
could do it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Lady.</span> What, find the rabbit inside those boxes, when they
were all corded up, and sealed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The M. in E. D.</span> You don't mean to say you were taken in by
<i>that</i>! Why, it was another rabbit, of course!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Lady.</span> But even if it <i>was</i> another rabbit, it was wearing the
borrowed watch round its neck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[ 6]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The M. in E. D.</span> Easy enough to slip the watch in, if all the
boxes have false bottoms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second L.</span> Yes, but he passed the boxes round for us to examine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The M. in E. D.</span> Boxes&mdash;but not <i>those</i> boxes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First L.</span> But how could he slip the watch in when somebody was
holding it all the time in a paper bag?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The M. in E. D.</span> Ah, <i>I</i> saw how it was done&mdash;but it would take too
long to explain it now. I <i>have</i> seen it so well performed that you <i>couldn't</i>
spot it. But this chap's a regular duffer!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herr V. K.</span> (<i>who finds this sort of thing rather disturbing</i>). Lyties
and Shentilmans, I see zere is von among us who is a brofessional

Around the walls are ranged several statues of meek aspect, securely

centre, a labyrinthine grove of pedestals, surmounted by busts, groups,
and statuettes by modern Italian masters. About these pedestals a small
crowd&mdash;consisting of Elderly Merchants on the look out for a "neat

Upholsterers' Buyers, Obliging Brokers, and Grubby and Mysterious

for the Princess Homai resembles the story told in the Hebrew Bible

Dear, dear, how interesting, now! and, Bobby, what <i>do</i> you think some one

him&mdash;something went wrong with the works, and she was instantly
redooced to a cinder. I fortunately 'appened to be near at the time (you

of females, peer into the carriages as they pass, and derive an occult

circulate behind them, roving from carriage to carriage, straining and
staring in at the occupants with the childlike interest of South Sea
Islanders. The coachmen and footmen gaze impassively before them,
ignoring the crowd to the best of their ability. The ladies in the carriages

really first-rate article, and are prepared to spend any amount of money on
<i>pushing</i> it, you know, you're sure to see a handsome return for your outlay&mdash;in
the long run. And of course you must get it carefully analysed by
competent judges&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M. G.</span> Ah, but <i>you</i> can feel independent of criticism now,
can't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Oh, I defy any one to find anything unwholesome in it&mdash;it's as
suitable for the most delicate child as it is for adults&mdash;nothing to irritate
the most sensitive&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M. G.</span> Ah, you mean certain critics are so thin-skinned&mdash;they are:
indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> (<i>warming to his subject</i>). But the beauty of this particular
composition is that it causes absolutely no unpleasantness or inconvenience

two cases of long-standing erysipelas it has completely cured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M. G.</span> (<i>rather at sea</i>). How gratifying that must be. But that is
the magic of all truly great work, it is such an <i>anodyne</i>&mdash;it takes people so
completely out of themselves&mdash;doesn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> It takes anything of that sort out of <i>them</i>, Ma'am. It's the
finest discovery of the age, no household will be without it in a few months&mdash;though
perhaps I say it who shouldn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M. G.</span> (<i>still more astonished</i>). Oh, but I <i>like</i> to hear you. I'm so
tired of hearing people pretending to disparage what they have done, it's
such a <i>pose</i>, and I hate posing. Real genius is <i>never</i> modest. (<i>If he had

you would come and see me on one of my Tuesdays, <span class="smcap">Mr. Tablett</span>, I should
feel so honoured, and I think you would meet some congenial spirits&mdash;do look
in some evening&mdash;I will send you a card if I may&mdash;let me see&mdash;could you
come and lunch next Sunday? I've got a little man coming who was very
nearly eaten up by cannibals. I think <i>he</i> would interest you.</p>

particularly vigorous expression. Her Gracious Majesty the Queen is
repeatedly described as "this mis-rubble ole bein'," an Archbishop is
invariably mentioned as an "Arch-rogue," while the orators and the
audience appear from their remarks to be the only persons capable of
worthily guiding this unhappy Country's destinies. Policemen in couples

<h2>The Riding-Class.</h2>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A Riding-school, on a raw chilly afternoon. The gas is lighted,
but does not lend much cheerfulness to the interior, which is bare and
bleak, and pervaded by a bluish haze. Members of the Class discovered
standing about on the tan, waiting for their horses to be brought in. At
the further end is an alcove, with a small balcony, in which</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Bilbow-Kay</span>, <i>the Mother of one of the Equestrians, is seated with a
young female Friend</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bilbow-Kay.</span> Oh, Robert used to ride very nicely indeed when
he was a boy; but he has been out of practice lately, and so, as the Doctor
ordered him horse-exercise, I thought it would be wiser for him to take a
few lessons. Such an excellent change for any one with sedentary
pursuits!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Friend.</span> But isn't riding a sedentary pursuit, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.-K.</span> Robert says <i>he</i> doesn't find it so.</p>

you'd better ride the <i>Shar</i>; he ain't been out all day, so he'll want some
'andling. (Mr. B.-K., <i>with a sickly smile, accepts a tall and lively horse</i>.)
No, Mr. Tongs, that ain't <i>your</i> 'orse to-day&mdash;you've got beyond <i>'im</i>, Sir.
We'll put you up on <i>Lady Loo</i>; she's a bit rough till you get on terms
with her, but you'll be all right on her after a bit. Yes, Mr. Joggles, Sir,
you take <i>Kangaroo</i>, please. Mr. Bumpas, I've 'ad the <i>Artful Dodger</i> out
for you; and mind he don't get rid of you so easy as he did Mr. Gripper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[ 105]</a></span>

'orses up into line, and stand by, ready to mount at the word of command,
reins taken up in the left 'and with the second and little fingers, and a lock

Number off! Walk! I shall give the word to trot directly, so now's the
time to improve your seats&mdash;that back a bit straighter, Mr. 'Ooper. No. 4
just fall out, and we'll let them stirrup-leathers down another 'ole or two
for yer. (<i>No. 4, who has just been congratulating himself that his stirrups

away with you already. Very bad, Mr. Joggles, Sir&mdash;keep those 'eels
down! Lost your stirrup, Mr. Jelly? Never mind that&mdash;<i>feel</i> for it, Sir. I
want you to be independent of the irons. I'm going to make you ride
without 'em presently. (Mr. Jelly <i>shivers in his saddle</i>.) Captin' Cropper,
Sir; if that Volunteer ridgment as you're goin' to be the Major of sees
you like you are now, on a field-day&mdash;they'll 'ave to fall out to <i>larf</i>, Sir!

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.-K.</span> He's very rude to all the Class, except dear Robert&mdash;but
then Robert has such a nice easy seat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The R. M.</span> Mr. Bilbow-Kay, Sir, try and set a bit closer. Why, you
ain't no more 'old on that saddle than a stamp with the gum licked off!
Can-ter! <i>You're</i>, all right, Mr. Joggles&mdash;it's on'y his play; set down on
your saddle, Sir!... I didn't say on the ground!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.-K.</span> (<i>anxiously to her</i> <span class="smcap">Son</span>, <i>as he passes</i>). Bob, are you quite

ain't Turks 'ere!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> (<i>sotto voce</i>). "There's <i>one</i> bloomin' Turk 'ere, anyway!"</p>

<p>R. M. Now then&mdash;Walk!... Trot! Set back, Gentlemen, set back
all&mdash;'old on by your knees, not the pommels. <i>I</i> see you, Mr. Jelly, kitchin'
old o' the mane&mdash;I shall 'ave to give you a 'ogged 'orse next time you come.
Quicken up a bit&mdash;this is a ride, not a funeral. Why, I could <i>roll</i> faster
than you're trotting! Lor, you're like a row o' Guy Foxes on 'orseback,
you are! Ah, I thought I'd see one o' you orf! Goa-ron, all o' you, you don't
come 'ere to <i>play</i> at ridin'&mdash;I'll make you ride afore I've done with you!
'Ullo, Mr. Joggles, nearly gone that time, Sir! There, that'll do&mdash;or we'll
'ave all your saddles to let unfurnished. Wa&mdash;alk! Mr. Bilbow-Kay, when
your 'orse changes his pace sudden, it don't look well for you to be found
settin' 'arf way up his neck, and it gives him a bad opinion of yer, Sir.
Uncross stirrups! Trot on! It ain't no mortal use your clucking to that
mare, Mr. Tongs, Sir, because she don't understand the langwidge&mdash;touch
her with your 'eel in the ribs. Mr. Sniggers, that 'orse is doin' jest what

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> (<i>with spirit</i>). <i>I</i> ain't going to 'it 'im. If you want him 'it, get

<p>R. M. When I say "Circle Right"&mdash;odd numbers'll wheel round and
fall in be'ind even ones. Circle <i>Right</i>!... Well, if ever I&mdash;I didn't tell
yer to fall <i>off</i> be'ind. Ketch your 'orses and stick to 'em next time. Right
In-<i>cline</i>! O' course, Mr. Joggles, if you prefer takin' that animal for a little
ride all by himself we'll let you out in the streets&mdash;otherwise p'raps you'll
kindly follow yer leader. Captain Cropper, Sir, if you let that curb out a
bit more, <i>Reindeer</i> wouldn't be 'arf so narsty with yer.... Ah, now you

Sir, you do. 'Alt, the rest of you.... Now, seein' you're shook down in
your saddles a bit&mdash;["<i>Shook</i> up'<i>s</i> <i>more like it</i>!" <i>from</i> Mr. S.]&mdash;we'll 'ave

<p><span class="smcap">Assist. R. M.</span> This lot don't look much like going over 'urdles&mdash;'cept

<h2>A Christmas Romp.</h2>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mrs. Chipperfield's</span> <i>Drawing-room</i>. <i>It is after the Christmas
dinner, and the Gentlemen have not yet appeared.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> <i>is laboriously
attempting to be gracious to her Brother's Fiancée, whose acquaintance
she has made for the first time, and with whom she is disappointed</i>.
<i>Married Sisters and Maiden Aunts confer in corners with a sleepy
acidity.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Married Sister</span> (<i>to Second</i>). I felt quite sorry for Fred, to
see him sitting there, looking&mdash;and no wonder&mdash;so ashamed of himself&mdash;but
I always will say, and I always <i>must</i> say, Caroline, that if you and
Robert had been <i>firmer</i> with him when he was younger, he would never
have turned out so badly! Now, there's my George&mdash;&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>to the Fiancée</i>). Well, my dear, I don't approve of young
men getting engaged until they have some prospect of being able to
marry, and dear Algy was always my favourite brother, and I've seen so
much misery from long engagements. However, we must hope for the
best, that's all!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Maiden Aunt</span> (<i>to Second Ditto</i>). Exactly what struck <i>me</i>, Martha.
<i>One</i> waiter would have been quite sufficient, and if James <i>must</i> be grand
and give champagne, he might have given us a little <i>more</i> of it; I'm sure
I'd little else but foam in <i>my</i> glass! And every plate as cold as a stone,
and you and I the only people who were not considered worthy of silver
forks, and the children encouraged to behave as they please, and Joseph
Podmore made such a fuss with, because he's well off&mdash;and not enough
sweetbread to go the round. Ah, well, thank goodness, we needn't dine
here for another year!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[ 116]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chipperfield</span> (<i>at the door</i>). Sorry to cut you short in your
cigar, Uncle, and you, Limpett; but fact is, being Christmas night, I
thought we'd come up a little sooner and all have a bit of a romp....
Well, Emily, my dear, here we are, all of us&mdash;ready for anything in the
way of a frolic&mdash;what's it to be? Forfeits, games, Puss in the Corner,
something to cheer us all up, eh? Won't any one make a suggestion?</p>

<p class="center">[<i>General expression of gloomy blankness.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Algernon</span> (<i>to his Fiancée&mdash;whom he wants to see shine</i>). Zeffie, you
know no end of games&mdash;what's that one you played at home, with potatoes
and a salt-spoon, <i>you</i> know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zeffie</span> (<i>blushing</i>). No, <i>please</i>, Algy! I don't know <i>any</i> games, indeed,
I couldn't <i>really</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> Uncle Joseph will set us going, I'm sure&mdash;what do <i>you</i> say,
Uncle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uncle Joseph.</span> Well, I won't say "no" to a quiet rubber.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> But, you see, we can't <i>all</i> play in that, and there <i>is</i> a pack of
cards in the house somewhere; but I know two of the aces are gone, and
I don't think all the court cards were there the last time we played. Still,
if you can manage with what is left, we might get up a game for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uncle J.</span> (<i>grimly</i>). Thank you, my dear, but, on the whole, I think
I would almost rather romp&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> Uncle Joseph votes for romping! What do you say to
Dumb Crambo? Great fun&mdash;half of us go out, and come in on all-fours,
to rhyme to "cat," or "bat," or something&mdash;<i>you</i> can play that, Limpett?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Limpett.</span> If I <i>must</i> find a rhyme to cat, I prefer, so soon after
dinner, not to go on all-fours for it, I confess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> Well, let's have something quieter, then&mdash;only <i>do</i> settle.
Musical Chairs, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Algy.</span> Zeffie will play the piano for you&mdash;she plays beautifully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zeffie.</span> Not without notes, Algy, and I forgot to bring my music
with me. Shall we play "Consequences"? It's a very quiet game&mdash;you
play it sitting down, with paper and pencil, you know!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Limpett</span> (<i>sardonically, and sotto voce</i>). Ah, this is something <i>like</i>
a rollick now. "Consequences," eh?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[ 117]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Algy</span> (<i>who has overheard&mdash;in a savage undertone</i>). If that isn't good
enough for you, suggest something better&mdash;or shut up!</p>

<p class="center">[<span class="smcap">Mr. L.</span> <i>prefers the latter alternative</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> Now, then, have you given everybody a piece of paper,

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Caroline.</span> No, James, I'd rather look on, and see you all
enjoying yourselves&mdash;I've <i>no</i> animal spirits now!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> Oh, nonsense! Christmas-time, you know. Let's be jolly

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt C.</span> No, I can't, really. You must excuse me. I know I'm a

<p class="center">[<i>The Family Failure collapses</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Limpett.</span> Well, as we've all got pencils, is there any reason why
the revelry should not commence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> No&mdash;don't let's waste any more time. Miss Zeffie says she
will write down on the top of her paper "Who met whom" (must be a
Lady and Gentleman in the party, you know), then she folds it down, and
passes it on to the next, who writes, "What he said to her"&mdash;the next,
"What she said to him"&mdash;next, "What the consequences were," and the
last, "What the world said." Capital game&mdash;first-rate. Now, then!</p>

Children, you must be very quiet and attentive, and then we shall be able,
as we purpose this evening, to show you some scenes illustrative of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[ 132]</a></span>&mdash;er&mdash;beautiful
old story of <i>Valentine and Orson</i>, which I doubt not is
familiar to you all. (<i>Rustic applause, conveyed by stamping and shrill cheers,
after which a picture is thrown on the screen representing a Village Festival.</i>)
Here, children, we have a view of&mdash;er&mdash;(<i>with sudden inspiration</i>)&mdash;Valentine's
Native Village. It is&mdash;er&mdash;his birthday, and Valentine, being
a young man who is universally beloved on account of his amiability and
good conduct&mdash;(<i>To the</i> <span class="smcap">Vicar's D.</span> "Is that correct?" <span class="smcap">The V.'s D.</span>
"Quite, <i>quite</i> correct!")&mdash;good conduct, the villagers are celebrating the&mdash;er&mdash;auspicious
event by general rejoicings. How true it is that if we
are only <i>good</i>, we may, young as we are, count upon gaining the affection
and esteem of all around us! (<i>A Youthful Rustic, with a tendency to
heckle.</i> "Ef 'ee plaze, Zur, which on 'em be Valentoine?") Valentine, we
may be very sure, would not be absent on such an occasion, although,
owing to the crowd, we cannot distinguish him. But, wherever he is, however
he may be occupied, he little thinks that, before long, he will have to
encounter the terrible Orson, the Wild Man of the Woods! Ah, dear
children, we all have our Wild Man of the Woods to fight. With <i>some of</i>
us it is&mdash;(<i>He improves the occasion</i>). Our next picture represents&mdash;(<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Assistant</span>). Sure this comes next? Oh, they're all numbered, are they?
Very well&mdash;represents a forest&mdash;er&mdash;the home of Orson. If we were
permitted to peep behind one of those trunks, we should doubtless see
Orson himself, crouching in readiness to spring upon the unsuspecting
Valentine. So, often when we&mdash;&amp;c., &amp;c. The next scene we shall show
you represents the&mdash;er&mdash;burning of Valentine's ship. Valentine has gone
on a voyage, with the object of&mdash;er&mdash;finding Orson. If the boat in the
picture was only larger, we could no doubt identify Valentine, sitting
there undismayed, calmly confident that, notwithstanding this&mdash;er&mdash;unfortunate
interruption, he will be guided, sooner or later, to his&mdash;er&mdash;goal.
Yes, dear children, if we only have patience, if we only have faith,
&amp;c., &amp;c. Here we see&mdash;(<i>an enormous Bison is suddenly depicted on the
screen</i>) eh? oh, yes&mdash;here we have a specimen of&mdash;er&mdash;Orson's <i>pursuits</i>.
He chases the bison. Some of you may not know what a bison is. It is
a kind of hairy cow, and&mdash;(<i>He describes the habits of these creatures as fully</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[ 133]</a></span>
<i>as he is able.</i>) (<span class="smcap">The Youthful Rustic.</span> "Theer baint nawone a-erntin' of
'un, Zur.") What? Oh, but there <i>is</i>, you know. Orson is pursuing him,
only&mdash;er&mdash;the bison, being a very fleet animal, has outrun his pursuer for
the moment. Sometimes we flatter ourselves that we have outrun <i>our</i>
pursuer&mdash;but, depend upon it, &amp;c., &amp;c. But now let us see what Valentine
is about&mdash;(<i>Discovering, not without surprise, that the next picture is a Scene
in the Arctic Regions</i>). Well, you see, he has succeeded in reaching the
coast, and here he is&mdash;in a sledge drawn by a reindeer, with nothing to guide
him but the Aurora Borealis, hastening towards the spot where he has
been told he will find Orson. He doesn't despair, doesn't lose heart&mdash;he
is sure that, if he only keeps on, if he&mdash;er&mdash;only continues, only perseveres&mdash;(<i>Aside.</i>

the&mdash;ah&mdash;home of Valentine's <i>mother</i>. You will observe a light in
the casement. By that light the good old woman is sitting, longing and
praying for the return of her gallant boy. Ah, dear children, what a thing
a good old mother is! (<i>To the</i> <span class="smcap">Vicar's Daughter</span>.) "I really can <i>not</i> keep

nearer to finding Orson than before. (<span class="smcap">The Young Heckler.</span> "Naw moor
be we, Zur. We ain't zeed <i>nayther</i> on 'em zo fur!" <i>Tumult, and a

songster the Thrush&mdash;better known to some of you, I dare say, as the
Throstle, or Mavis! (<i>He gives the Thrush&mdash;which somehow doesn't "go."</i>)
I shall next endeavour to represent that celebrated and tuneful singing-bird&mdash;the
Sky-lark. (<i>He does it, but the Lark doesn't quite come off.</i>) I
shall next try to give you those two sweet singers, the Male and Female
Canary&mdash;the gentleman in the stalls with the yellow 'air will represent the
female bird on this occasion, he must not be offended, for it is a 'igh compliment
I am paying him, a harmless professional joke. (<i>The Canaries

a bottle of gingerbeer, and drinking it afterwards.</p>

saying, as cool as you please&mdash;&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Heroine on Stage.</span> "Ah, no, no&mdash;you
would not ruin me? You will not tell my husband?") So I told her.
"I'm very sorry," I says, "but I can't lend that frying-pan to nobody." So I
got up. Two hours <i>after</i>, as I was going down stairs, she come out of her

"Oh, jolly," I says, or somethink o' that sort&mdash;<i>I</i> wasn't going to take no

nothing, and <i>I</i> didn't say nothing; and so it went on till Monday&mdash;<i>well</i>!

you! I've had enough of this fooling! Give me money, or I'll twist your

she <i>'ad</i>&mdash;no, let me finish <i>my</i> story first. Well, just fancy <i>'er</i> now! She
asked me to step in; and she says, "Ow are you?" and was very nice, and
I never said a word&mdash;not wishing to bring up the past, and&mdash;I didn't tell

<p><span class="smcap">Miss F. B.</span> (<i>with genuine feeling</i>).</p>

<p>
Who would imagine one meek-voiced girl could have held her own in a deafening din!<br />
But Lobelia's scholars discovered soon she'd a dead-sure notion of discipline;<br />
For her satin palm had a sting like steel, and the rowdiest rebel respected her,<br />
When she'd stretched out six of the hardest lots in the Bible-Class with a Derringer!<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soc. Chat.</span> No, a very dull party, you could move about quite easily

<p><span class="smcap">Miss F. B.</span> (<i>with as much conviction as possible under the circumstances</i>).</p>

<p>
And the silence deepened; no creature stirred in the stagnant hush, and the only sound<br />
Was the far-off lumbering jolt, produced by the prairie rolling for leagues around!<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soc. Chat.</span> (<i>crescendo</i>). Oh, an old aunt of mine has gone in for
step-dancing&mdash;she's had several lessons ... and cut her knees rather

<p><span class="smcap">Miss F. B.</span> (<i>excitedly</i>).</p>

<p>
But hark! in the distance a weird shrill cry, a kinder mournful, monotonous yelp&mdash;<br />
(<i>Further irruption of</i> <span class="smcap">Society Chatter</span>) ... is it jackal?&mdash;bison?&mdash;a cry for help.<br />

<p>
My horse was a speck on the pampas' verge, for I dropped the rein in my haste to stoop;<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Miss F. B.</span></p>

<p>
I rose to my feet with quivering knees, and my face went white as a fresh-washed towel;<br />

<p>
"What! leave you to face those fiends alone!" she cried, and slid from her horse's back;<br />
"Let me die with you&mdash;for I love you, Clem!" Then she gave her steed a resounding smack,<br />
And he bounded off; "Now Heaven be praised that my school six-shooter I brought!" said she.<br />
"Four barrels I'll keep for the front-rank foes&mdash;and the next for you&mdash;and the last for me!"<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soc. Chat.</span> Is it a <i>comic</i> piece she's doing, do you know? Don't

Quite impossible to hear one's self speak, <i>isn't</i> it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss F. B.</span></p>

<p>
And ever louder the demons yelled for their pale-faced prey&mdash;but I scorned death's pangs,<br />
For I deemed it a doom that was half delight to die by the hand of Lobelia Bangs!<br />
Then she whispered low in her dulcet tones, like the crooning coo of a cushat dove!<br />
(<i>At the top of her voice.</i>) "Forgive me, Clem, but I could not bear any squaw to torture my own true love!"<br />
And she raised the revolver&mdash;"crack-crack-crack!"<br />

<h2>Bank Holiday.</h2>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The Crystal Palace. The Nave is filled with a dense throng of
Pleasure-seekers. Every free seat commanding the most distant view of
a Variety Performance on the Great Stage has been occupied an hour in
advance. The less punctual stand and enjoy the spectacle of other persons'
hats or bonnets. Gangs of Male and Female Promenaders jostle and
hustle to their hearts' content, or perform the war-song and dance of the
Lower-class 'Arry, which consists in chanting "Oi tiddly-oi-toi; hoi-toi-oi!"
to a double shuffle. Tired women sit on chairs and look at nothing.
In the Grounds, the fancy of young men and maidens is lightly turning
to thoughts of love; the first dawn of the tender passion being intimated,
on the part of the youth, by chasing his charmer into a corner and partially
throttling her, whereupon the maiden coyly conveys that his sentiments
are not unreciprocated by thumping him between the shoulders.
From time to time, two champions contend with fists for the smiles of
beauty, who may usually be heard bellowing with perfect impartiality in
the background. A small but increasing percentage have already had
as much liquid refreshment as is good for them, and intend to have more.
Altogether, the scene, if festive, might puzzle an Intelligent Foreigner
who is more familiar with Continental ideas of enjoyment.</i></p>

corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
